# Heart disease machine learning model

This is a machine learning model intended as a non-invasive
pre-screening tool for the presence of heart disease in a patient.

This model was trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset and resulted
in 100% accuracy when using an 80%/20% training-testing split.
